    <h2>Rules of Hnefatafl:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Black moves first.</li>
      <li>Black's objective is to surround the white king on all four sides, or
          on three sides plus the central square (the throne).</li>
      <li>White's objective is for the king to escape to a corner square.</li>
      <li>The king cannot be captured along the edge of the board.</li>
      <li>Capturing is via <i>custodial capture</i>: a piece is captured if
        it is sandwiched between two enemy pieces, but <i>only</i> if it is
        sandwiches as a result of an enemy move --- ie. you can move a piece
        between two enemy pieces, and your piece is not captured as a result.
      <li>The corner squares are hostile to black for the purpose of
        capturing.</li>
      <li>The throne is always hostile to black, but hostile to white only
        when unoccupied.</li>
      <li>A player with no valid moves loses the game.</li>
